# Aether Commons
This module contains all classes and functions which are required by all other modules in AetherElements, 
like domain model and database.

## Database
I decided to use a very simple model with json, csv and text files, in order that you can add more modules of your own.
So you can write your modules in any language, like for example python, and it still works with the same "database".
